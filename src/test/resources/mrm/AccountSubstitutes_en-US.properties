labelPage = Substitutes
pageDescription = You can set up substitutes and delegate your tasks to these substitutes so that your tasks do not remain unfinished in the system if, for example, you are prevented from doing so by an absence. During a delegation, the system sends messages to the specified substitute and the substitute completes tasks such as approvals with your rights. You can set up delegation for the Media Pool, Web-to-Publish, Marketing Shop, and Job Manager modules.

Once you have selected at least one substitute, start the delegation for a certain time or indefinitely by clicking the Start delegation button. The delegation can be terminated at any time by clicking the Stop delegation button.
